# IslandsInternship
The scripts and Excel sheets of my internship in Island Biogeography üèùÔ∏è

You can find in this GITHUB the scripts I used to conduct both the DAISIEPrep and the DAISIE analysis and the scripts to check the clades for both Amphibians and Squamates of Madagascar. There are also the results of this analysis, in the RDS format for the DAISIEPrep and in CSV format for the DAISIE. Three models were applied to each phylogenetic tree and the final results of DAISIE have the ones with the biggest likelihood for each tree.

There are also the results of the updates of the checklists and the update of the Red List Status for the Mammals of Madagascar.
